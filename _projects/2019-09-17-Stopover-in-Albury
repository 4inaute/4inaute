### Days 2 & 3 of our Fraser Island Journey

We made the most of our time in Albury with family, despite the weather which was mostly cloudy and raining, although rain is always welcome in the region.

Having recently acquired the trailer for this trip our shed at home was full which meant our boat was moved out and transported to Albury. Sunday was a great opportunity to launch the boat at Bowna and do some trolling on Lake Hume. The water was only at 43% so it was a long way down the boat ramp. No luck with the fish but the kids loved the experience, even though Amber did initially squeal and skipper Lewis had the boat doing circles! The bird life was also a highlight.

We filled our time with playgrounds, scootering, visiting the Murray River at Mungabareena Reserve, minor trailer alterations, gardening, reading, shared meals, birthday celebrations, wedding planning, scenic drives to Bethanga Bridge, movies and Intensity.

Being coffee lovers, we made an important visit to Zoâ€™i Espresso in Albury to stock up. It was roasting day and we picked up the Baristas Blend which they custom ground for our camping coffee machine.

Next we head north via inland NSW.
